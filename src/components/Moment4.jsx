        <p>To my best friend,</p>
        <br />
        <p>I was thinking about everything we've been through lately. Life gets so loud sometimes that we forget to stop and say the important things.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Thank you for being the person who knows exactly what I’m thinking without me saying a word. Thank you for the laughs that turn into silent wheezing and the support that feels like home.</p>
        <br />
        <p>You are rare, you are kind, and I am so lucky to walk through life with you.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Happy Birthday.</p>
