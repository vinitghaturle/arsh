        <p>To Arshiya,</p>
        <br />
        <p>Somewhere between random conversations, shared laughs, and just being there without trying too hard, you became someone I genuinely value.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Thank you for being easy to talk to, easy to trust, and easy to laugh with. Thank you for the moments that didn’t need planning and the support that never felt forced.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Happy Birthday, Arsh.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Have the kind of year you truly deserve.</p>
